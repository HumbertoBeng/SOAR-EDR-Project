# SOAR EDR Project

## Objective
The objective of this project was to simulate an attack on a virtual machine and track the incident via an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool. We then created a customised Detection & Response Rule to alert the malicious behaviour within our machine. Following that, we created a Playbook/Story to handle the response to the alert. This Playbook/Story was created to notify via Slack and email, and will also prompt the user to select whether to isolate or not the compromised machine.
